Reflection on Responsive web design 2 final project. The final came and with it plenty of challenges. With at least 8 hours of work I managed to pump something decent out. The greatest challenge was the merging of the 2 images, the ironman with the grid in the back. I had to go through many a trail an error until finding the proper code that worked. Starting with mobile views was definitely the right call, making it much easier to expand the layout vs compacting it. The portfolio page presented its own difficulties as well. The animation wasn’t necessary but I’m glad I put the effort in to complete it to a presentable state. To address the elephant in the room I kept the position absolute.  I now realize it could’ve been so much easier if I did a grid instead but I was too far into the site and the deadline was coming up so I kept it and moved on. In future projects however I will be using grid and or flex to get the job done quicker and with a lot less stress.
